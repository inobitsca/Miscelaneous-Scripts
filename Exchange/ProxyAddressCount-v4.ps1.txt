Features:
    1) This script creates a CSV output of everyone's SMTP proxy addresses.
    2) Reports to the screen the total number of users found.
    3) Reports to the screen the user(s) with the most proxy addresses.
    4) You can configure the threshold of users reported.  
        For example, if you only wanted users with 2 or more proxy addresses included, 
        you should change the line: "$Threshold = 0" to "$Threshold = 2"
Misc:
    A) This uses "get-recipient" with no filters by default.  You may want to 
        replace this with something more restrictive, like "get-mailbox", or use the 
        -filter parameter.
